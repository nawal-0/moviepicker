# 6. Google Authentication Only Strategy

**Date:** 20-05-2025

**Status:** Accepted

## Summary

In the context of simplifying user authentication and reducing security overhead, facing the complexity of managing traditional username/password authentication with password reset flows, validation, and security concerns, we decided to implement Google OAuth as the exclusive authentication method, to achieve simplified user onboarding, enhanced security through a trusted provider, and reduced development maintenance burden, accepting dependency on Google services and requirement for users to have Google accounts.

## Context

• Traditional username/password authentication requires complex implementation of password hashing, validation, reset flows, and security measures
• Users increasingly expect social login options for faster registration and reduced password fatigue
• Managing password security, storage, and recovery adds significant development and maintenance overhead
• Google OAuth provides robust security, user verification, and trusted authentication infrastructure
• The application targets users who are likely to have Google accounts for accessing other services
• Security breaches related to password management could damage user trust and application reputation
• Development team wants to focus on core movie recommendation features rather than authentication infrastructure
• Regulatory compliance for password storage and user data protection adds complexity

## Decision

Implement Google OAuth as the exclusive authentication method for the MoviePicker application:

**Implementation Details:**
• Remove all traditional login and signup forms with username/password fields
• Integrate Google OAuth API for user authentication and authorization
• Use Google-provided user information (name, email, profile picture) for user profiles
• Implement OAuth token management for session handling
• Remove password-related database fields, validation logic, and reset functionality
• Update all authentication-related UI components to use Google sign-in buttons
• Ensure graceful error handling for OAuth failures and account linking issues

The authentication flow becomes: Google Sign-In → Token Validation → Application Access

## Consequences

**Advantages:**
• Significantly reduced security risk by eliminating password storage and management
• Faster user registration and login experience (one-click authentication)
• Reduced development time and complexity for authentication infrastructure
• Leverages Google's robust security measures, 2FA, and account recovery systems
• Eliminates need for password reset, validation, and strength requirements
• Reduced support burden for password-related user issues
• Automatic user verification through Google's account validation
• Access to verified user information (email, name) from trusted source

**Neutral:**
• Dependency on Google services for critical application functionality
• User profiles tied to Google account information and availability
• Need to handle OAuth token refresh and expiration scenarios
• Requires clear communication to users about authentication method

**Disadvantages:**
• Users without Google accounts cannot access the application
• Potential privacy concerns from users who prefer not to use Google services
• Application becomes unavailable if Google OAuth services experience outages
• Limited control over authentication user experience and branding
• Dependency on external service for core application functionality
• Potential compliance considerations depending on data handling requirements
